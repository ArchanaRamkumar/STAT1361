## Final Project

The following analysis conducted on this dataset is motivated by the interests of PA Reality, a new company aiming to gain insights into the property information that influence housing prices in Pittsburgh. My task was to implement a model for house prices, to allow a team of realtors to identify overpriced or underpriced homes by comparing the list price to the predicted house price.
